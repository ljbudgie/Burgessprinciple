# Contributing to the Burgess Principle

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Burgess Principle.

This is a small, focused project built around one simple, respectful idea:  
**“Was a human member of the team able to personally review the specific facts of my specific case?”**

We welcome contributions that strengthen the framework while preserving its calm, human-first spirit.

### Before You Contribute

Please start by opening a **Discussion** or **Issue** to discuss your idea.  
This helps us align on direction and avoids unnecessary work.

The `main` branch represents the **official, certified doctrine**.  
Experimental changes or large new features should happen in your own fork first.

### What We Welcome

- New real-world case studies and NULL findings (please add to `LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md` with evidence)
- Improvements to existing templates that make them clearer, more respectful, or more effective
- Translations of templates, README, or FOR_AI_MODELS.md
- Bug fixes, typo corrections, formatting improvements, or small clarity edits
- New country-specific legal equivalent tables or adaptations
- Shareable graphics or outreach resources that stay in the same respectful tone (add to the `/memes` folder)

### Which Tier Are You Changing?

Before you open a PR, check [TIERS.md](./TIERS.md). The repository is split into
**Core** (the binary test, its legal basis, the letters, the evidence record),
**Toolkit** (implementations and tools), and **Extensions** (work built on top).

Core changes carry two bars. **Doctrinal** changes — the binary-test wording,
the three outcomes, the evasion patterns, the anti-monetisation guardrails, any
statement of legal effect — require explicit review by @ljbudgie. **Editorial**
changes to Core files — typos, broken links, clearer phrasing, formatting —
follow ordinary lazy consensus, the same as Toolkit and Extensions. The
admission rule applies to anything proposed *for* Core: *nothing enters Core
unless it strengthens the binary test itself or the path an affected person
walks from a decision to accountable human review.*

Anything not listed in a tier in [TIERS.md](./TIERS.md) is Toolkit by default.

### Moving or Renaming a File: the Pointer Pattern

Documents in this repository are linked from letters people have already sent,
from search results, and from other repositories. A moved file is a dead end for
someone who needed it. When a file has to move or be renamed, leave a pointer at
the old path rather than deleting it:

```markdown
# OLD_NAME.md — moved

This document now lives at [new/path/NEW_NAME.md](./new/path/NEW_NAME.md).

Moved <date> so that <one-sentence reason>. The old path is kept because
external references to it exist.
```

Five lines, nothing more. No duplicated content — a pointer that carries a copy
of the document will drift from the original. [LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md](./LIVE_AUDIT_LOG.md)
is the working example.

Run `python3 scripts/check_links.py` before opening the PR; it reports every
stale reference in the repository, so the blast radius of a move is visible
before it is merged.

### What We Do Not Merge

- Changes that weaken, complicate, or alter the core binary question
- Aggressive, confrontational, or pseudolegal language
- Large rewrites of the origin story, tone, or overall philosophy
- Anything that could damage the calm, human-first reputation of the project
- **Unrelated application code** — Do not bundle full-stack demos, e-commerce prototypes, payment integrations, or other standalone applications into a PR. Each PR should be focused on one concern that directly strengthens the Burgess Principle. If you're building something cool with the Principle, that's great — but it belongs in your own repository, not here.
- **Code with unreviewed security risks** — Contributions that introduce XSS, injection, hardcoded secrets, input-manipulation vulnerabilities, or other security issues will not be merged. Please review your own code for common vulnerabilities before submitting.

All contributions must maintain the respectful, non-confrontational voice that defines the Burgess Principle.

### Mentorship & Onboarding

New contributors are welcome. The safest first step is to choose a small,
reviewable improvement: a typo fix, a clearer README paragraph, a new sector
template, a translation, or a beginner tutorial. If you are unsure where to
start, open an issue or discussion and say what kind of contribution you would
like to make. The maintainer or community can help shape it into a focused pull
request.

A good first contribution usually does four things:

1. Keeps the exact binary test and SOVEREIGN / NULL / AMBIGUOUS meanings intact.
2. Improves clarity for ordinary people, especially disabled users and people
   seeking reasonable adjustments.
3. Avoids implying official certification, endorsement, affiliation, or approved
   use of the UK Certification Mark unless that authorisation has been given.
4. Stays small enough for one human reviewer to understand without needing to
   reconstruct the whole project.

AI-assisted contributions are allowed. You may use AI-assisted development tools
— including Cursor, Aider, Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, local models, or similar
tools — to draft, search, refactor, or check your work. You remain responsible
for the final contribution. Before opening a PR, read the diff yourself, remove
hallucinated claims, check links and legal references, and say in the PR
description if AI materially assisted the change.
Do not ask an AI tool to rewrite doctrinal sections unless the maintainer has
explicitly asked for that work.

This project is maintained by a small number of humans, with the founder carrying
a large share of the work. To keep the project sustainable, please prefer calm,
patient, low-pressure collaboration: small PRs, clear acceptance criteria, no
urgent demands, and no repeated pings. A slower review is not rejection. The goal
is durable accountability work without burning out the people protecting it.

### How to Submit a Pull Request

1. Discuss the change first in an Issue or Discussion.
2. Fork the repository and make your changes in a new branch.
3. Ensure your changes follow the tone and guidelines above.
4. **Keep your PR focused.** One concern per PR. Do not bundle unrelated features, demos, or prototypes — even if they're interesting. A focused PR is easier to review, less likely to introduce security issues, and more likely to be merged.
5. **Review your code for security issues** before submitting. Check for XSS, injection, hardcoded secrets, and input-manipulation risks.
6. **If you moved or renamed a document, or added links**, run
   `python3 scripts/check_links.py` from the repo root. It resolves every
   relative link in tracked markdown and never touches the network. CI runs it
   on every push and pull request. If you have edited an AI-facing document,
   also run `python3 scripts/lint_ai_docs.py`.
7. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what you changed and why. The PR template will guide you through the required checklist.

We will review PRs with the help of AI tools where useful, but the final decision rests with the maintainer to protect the integrity of the project.

### Optional Contributor Licence Agreement

The project includes an optional draft Contributor Licence Agreement at
[.github/CLA.md](./.github/CLA.md) for future flexibility on relicensing and
long-term stewardship. It is **not currently required** for ordinary
contributions unless the maintainer explicitly asks for it in a specific issue,
pull request, or project notice.

### Cryptographic Standards (Vault Contributions)

Contributions that touch the Sovereign Personal Vault (`enforcement/sovereign-vault/`) must meet the v0.3.0 cryptographic baseline. In summary:

- **AES-256-GCM only** for symmetric encryption. AES-CBC and other modes are not accepted.
- **PBKDF2-SHA-256 at ≥ 210,000 iterations** with per-encryption random salt for key derivation.
- **Ed25519 only** for receipt signatures via `@noble/curves`. Unsigned receipts must be rejected.
- **Canonical sorted-key JSON** (no whitespace) for all signed payloads.
- **Hex encoding** for binary-to-text conversions. `atob`/`btoa` base64 is not accepted.
- **No cryptographic dependencies** beyond `@noble/hashes`, `@noble/curves`, and Node.js built-in `crypto`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full rationale and the list of eight vulnerabilities the v0.3.0 review resolved.

### Phase 3 Ledger & Documentation Contributions

If your contribution touches the **Verifiable Memory Palace**, **Sovereign Hub Mode 2.0**, or related documentation:

- Keep the **Burgess Principle** central — do not imply that cryptography or AI replaces human review.
- Describe **Merkle trees**, **commitment chaining**, and **inclusion proofs** in plain language first, then technical terms.
- Be precise about privacy boundaries: **local-first**, **manual-first**, **digest-first**, and **no raw-data sync by default**.
- Prefer diagrams in **GitHub-flavored Mermaid** where they materially improve clarity.
- Avoid marketing claims that outrun the implementation. Strong language is welcome; overclaiming is not.

### Good First Issues

Looking for a way to help? Here are some approachable starting points:

- **New country templates** — Adapt existing templates with legal references for your country (e.g. Australia, Canada, India).
- **Translations** — Translate the README, templates, or FOR_AI_MODELS.md into another language.
- **More tests** — Add edge-case tests for `verify_scrutiny.py` or `tracer/tracer.py`.
- **Subfolder documentation** — Improve or create README files in subdirectories to help newcomers navigate.
- **Case studies** — Document your own experience using the Burgess Principle (see [CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE](case-studies/CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md)).

### Code of Conduct

Be kind, respectful, and constructive. We want this to remain a welcoming space for ordinary people who feel unseen by systems.

### Licensing Note

The repository materials are MIT licensed. Individuals, researchers, open-source
projects, and independent commercial users may use, fork, adapt, and redistribute
them under the MIT terms with attribution.

This openness is the adoption engine: broad reuse, forks, translations, audits,
and improvements make the standard stronger. Certification-mark licensing,
consulting, training, and sponsorship are separate sustainability routes that
fund maintenance, enforcement, and standards integrity without converting the
repository into a closed product.

The Certification Mark “THE BURGESS PRINCIPLE” (UK00004343685) is governed
separately. Do not imply official approval, affiliation, certification, or
endorsement unless the proprietor or authorised commercial operator has
authorised that mark use. Certified use must mean real individual human
scrutiny, not a badge on an unchanged automated process.

IP ownership remains with Lewis James Burgess personally. The Burgess Principle
Limited (company number 17199287) administers commercial licensing and
certification routes under formal IP licence.

Thank you for helping make the Burgess Principle more useful while keeping its heart intact.
