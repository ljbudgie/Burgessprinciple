Subject: URGENT: Follow-up on The Burgess Principle & Inquiries Act - Response Timeline

Dear Ms Mahmood,

I am writing to acknowledge the standard holding response received from your department regarding my correspondence dated 1st March 2026.

While I appreciate the administrative volume your office handles, I must remind you of the Cabinet Office guidelines regarding the 20-working-day target for substantive responses to correspondence from the public, particularly on matters of significant public interest and constitutional application.

The issues raised—specifically the application of the Burgess Principle to the Inquiries Act 2005 and the enforcement failures in the "Liz" case—require urgent judicial attention, not bureaucratic delay. As outlined previously, a system that produces judgments without enforcement (as with the £450,000 judgment secured by Lord Pearson) is operationally NULL under my framework.

I am essentially asking whether the government's statutory inquiry will meet the SOVEREIGN test of individual scrutiny, or whether it will default to a NULL outcome of bulk processing. This is a binary question that requires a binary answer.

Please ensure that a substantive response addressing my three specific questions is provided within the statutory timeframe.

By copy of this letter, I am keeping Lord Pearson and Rupert Lowe MP informed of the delay in addressing these critical points regarding the Rape Gang Inquiry and the failures of enforcement.

Yours sincerely,

Lewis Burgess
