# Credit File Contradiction — County Court Judgments vs Magistrates’ Court Enforcement Route

**Date:** 26 February 2026  
**Author:** Lewis Burgess

## Summary

On 26 February 2026, a routine credit file review via ClearScore/Equifax revealed two County Court Judgments registered against Lewis Burgess at 3 Alwyn Road, Darlington, DL3 0AJ. These CCJs were issued by the Civil National Business Centre (a County Court bulk claims processing centre). If these debts relate to council tax, they have been pursued through a court with no jurisdiction. Council tax liability orders can only be granted by a Magistrates’ Court under Regulation 34 of the Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992.

## The Two CCJs:

- **CCJ 1:** 4 March 2024, £826, Civil National Business Centre, case reference L9FG1818  
- **CCJ 2:** 4 December 2024, £442, Civil National Business Centre, case reference L7EC1P3M

## The Contradiction

Prior correspondence with Darlington Borough Council and the Leader of the Council assumed the enforcement route for council tax went through the Magistrates’ Court, which is the only lawful route. The council never corrected this assumption. The credit file now shows County Court judgments, which creates an irreconcilable contradiction.  

- Either the council used a court with no jurisdiction (void ab initio), or these debts were pursued by a third party through the County Court without the debtor’s knowledge, or the enforcement paperwork does not match the court record.

## The Bind for Bailiffs

If bailiffs are currently enforcing on the basis of a Magistrates’ Court liability order, but the credit file shows County Court judgments, the instruments do not match. The bailiffs’ authority to enforce must derive from a lawful instrument. If the instrument they are relying on does not correspond to the court record on the credit file, the chain of authority is broken.

## Binary Test Applied

Was each CCJ individually scrutinised by a judicial mind before judgment was entered? The Civil National Business Centre processes approximately 2 million claims per year. Its architecture is designed for bulk processing, not individual judicial scrutiny. In the absence of evidence of individual scrutiny, both judgments score 0 (Null) under The Burgess Principle and are void ab initio.

## Cascading Nullity

If the source judgments are void, every downstream action inherits the nullity:

- Registration on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines
- Transmission of data to credit reference agencies
- Recording on the credit file
- Any bailiff enforcement derived from those judgments
- Any financial decisions (mortgage applications, credit terms, tenancy references) adversely affected by the void data

## Action Taken

A formal UK GDPR Article 5(1)(d) accuracy challenge was submitted to Equifax on 26 February 2026, demanding identification of the underlying claimants, verification of jurisdictional basis, immediate notice of dispute on both entries, and removal if accuracy cannot be verified. Statutory deadlines are now running.
