# Verifiable Human Oversight

**Part of the Burgess Principle ecosystem**  
**Version:** 0.2.0 (Phase 2 — cryptographic signing)  
**Language:** Python 3.11+  
**Dependencies:** stdlib only for the core test and records. Ed25519 signing is an optional add-on requiring [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/) (`pip install PyNaCl`).

---

## What this does

This module implements the **Burgess Binary Test** as executable, verifiable code.

It answers one question:

> "Was a named human being's mind applied to the specific facts of a specific person's case before institutional power was exercised?"

The answer is `SOVEREIGN`, `NULL`, or `AMBIGUOUS`. Every assessment produces a sealed `DecisionRecord` with a SHA-256 fingerprint — a tamper-evident record of the finding that can be transmitted, stored, and independently verified.

---

## Quick start

```python
from verifiable_oversight import BinaryTest, Verifier
from verifiable_oversight.domains import CommunicationDomain

domain = CommunicationDomain()

record = domain.create_record(
    subject="Fourth response — circular referral to EHRC",
    institution="EASS",
    binary_test=BinaryTest(
        named_person=None,
        role_and_authority=None,
        specific_facts_considered=None,
        pre_decision_timing=None,
        authority_to_differ=None,
        context="Four responses. No named individual. Circular referral.",
    ),
    channel="email (telephone number provided)",
    ra_on_record=True,
    ra_description="email-only communication",
    channel_accessible=False,
)

print(record)
# DecisionRecord(…) [NULL] EASS — Fourth response — circular referral to EHRC

verifier = Verifier()
report = verifier.verify(record)
print(report.is_valid)   # True — the NULL finding is correctly documented
print(record.fingerprint)  # SHA-256 fingerprint
```

---

## The five elements

All five must be present for `SOVEREIGN`. Any single absent element yields `NULL`.

| Element | What it requires |
|---|---|
| **Named person** | The full name of the individual — not "our team" |
| **Role and authority** | Their role AND the authority to reach a different outcome |
| **Specific facts considered** | Evidence this specific person's facts were reviewed |
| **Pre-decision timing** | Review happened *before* the decision was exercised |
| **Authority to differ** | Practical authority to reach a different conclusion |

**Process language does not satisfy any element.** "Reviewed by our team", "subject to human oversight", "considered by the relevant department" — zero elements. Ask directly: *"Please provide the full name and role of the individual who considered my specific case before this decision was made."*

## Running the examples

From the repo root:

```bash
python verifiable_oversight/examples/example_null.py
python verifiable_oversight/examples/example_sovereign.py
python verifiable_oversight/examples/example_ambiguous.py
python verifiable_oversight/examples/example_signed.py   # requires PyNaCl
```

No installation required for the first three. stdlib only. The signed example
additionally requires PyNaCl (`pip install PyNaCl`).

---

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SOVEREIGN` | All five elements present. Named human applied their mind to specific facts before the decision. |
| `NULL` | One or more elements absent. No evidence of meaningful human review meeting the Burgess standard. |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | Element status unknown — institution has not yet answered the direct question. Temporary state only. |

`NULL` ≠ illegal in all cases, but it is the prerequisite question before any legal challenge. A `NULL` process is a defective process. Under *Ahmed [2010] UKSC 5* and *Majera [2021] UKSC 46*, an unlawful institutional act cannot found enforceable rights against an individual regardless of what label is applied to it.

---

## Domains

Each domain extends the core test with domain-specific metadata and validation:

| Domain | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `general` | No extensions — pure binary test |
| `communication` | Channel vs RA compatibility; automated comms flag; regulatory framework |
| `legal` | Statutory basis; case reference; burden shift; bulk process presumption |

To add a new domain, subclass `BaseDomain` and implement `name`, `guidance`, and optionally `validate_domain_metadata` and `_build_domain_metadata`.

---

## Cryptographic integrity

Every `DecisionRecord` is sealed with a SHA-256 fingerprint on creation. The fingerprint covers all content fields. Any change to the record after sealing will cause `verify_integrity()` to return `False`.

The `signature` field carries an Ed25519 signature over the fingerprint (Phase 2 — see *Cryptographic signing* below). The data model supports it without structural changes — the signing infrastructure connects to the existing [`CRYPTOGRAPHIC_IDENTITY.md`](../CRYPTOGRAPHIC_IDENTITY.md) architecture.

---

## Cryptographic signing (Phase 2)

The fingerprint proves a record has **not changed**. A signature proves **who
produced it**. A `RecordSigner` holds an Ed25519 private key, signs the sealed
record's fingerprint, and attaches the signature and public key so any third
party can verify the finding **offline, with no shared secret**.

```python
from verifiable_oversight import (
    BinaryTest, DecisionRecord, RecordSigner, Verifier, verify_record_signature,
)

record = DecisionRecord.create(
    subject="Fourth response — circular referral to EHRC",
    institution="EASS",
    binary_test=BinaryTest(context="No named individual across four responses."),
)

signer = RecordSigner.generate()   # or RecordSigner(private_key_hex)
signer.sign(record)                # populates record.signature / public_key / signed_at

record.is_signed                   # True
record.public_key                  # publish this for independent verification
verify_record_signature(record)    # True

Verifier().verify(record).signature_ok  # True

# Tamper-evidence: any change after signing breaks both integrity and signature.
record.subject = "Altered"
verify_record_signature(record)    # False
```

**What signing adds:**

- **Non-repudiation** — the record is bound to the holder of a published public key.
- **Independent verification** — a tribunal, ombudsman, or opposing institution
  can verify the signature with only the record and the public key.
- **Backward compatible** — the signature lives *outside* the canonical
  fingerprint, so signing never changes a record's fingerprint, and unsigned
  records behave exactly as in Phase 1 (`Verifier` reports `signature_ok=None`).

The signed message is domain-separated and reproducible:
`SIGNING_CONTEXT + b":" + fingerprint` (see `signing_message`). PyNaCl is required
only for signing/verification; the stdlib core continues to work without it.

Run the signed example:

```bash
pip install PyNaCl
python verifiable_oversight/examples/example_signed.py
```

## Phase 2 roadmap

- **Cryptographic signing** ✅ *(this release)* — Ed25519 private key → `signature` field populated; public key attached for independent, offline verification
- **Record storage** — append-only SQLite or JSON-L log; records keyed by fingerprint
- **Iris integration** — Iris can create and verify records on behalf of a user in conversation
- **Email domain** — sovereign email application; each outbound communication creates a record; each institutional response is assessed on receipt
- **Banking domain** — FCA DISP deadlines; automated credit decision assessment
- **Medical domain** — clinical decision support; consent; Mental Capacity Act 2005
- **Post-quantum companion** — hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA/SLH-DSA signatures, reusing the `onchain-protocol` provider architecture

## Legal grounding

This module implements the Burgess standard as described in the SSRN working paper series. See [`papers/SSRN_INDEX.md`](../papers/SSRN_INDEX.md) and [`LEGAL_FOUNDATIONS.md`](../LEGAL_FOUNDATIONS.md).
