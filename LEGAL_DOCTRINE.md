# The Burgess Principle: A Citizen's Legal Doctrine

**Established:** 2026  
**Status:** Open Source / Public Domain  
**Core Maxim:** *Judicial consideration cannot be automated.*

## The Doctrine

The **Burgess Principle** asserts that search and entry warrants issued under the **Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954** are **void *ab initio*** (invalid from the start) when issued in bulk without individual judicial scrutiny.

### The Legal Argument

1.  **Requirement of Judicial Mind:** A Justice of the Peace (JP) or Magistrate is required by law to apply their judicial mind to the *specific facts* of each individual application. They must be satisfied, on oath, that admission to the premises is reasonably required.  
2.  **The "Bulk" Defect:** Energy companies often present hundreds of warrant applications in a single "bundle" to be signed in minutes.
    *   *Mathematically Impossible Review:* If a magistrate signs 500 warrants in 15 minutes, they have spent 1.8 seconds per warrant. This is insufficient time to read the address, let alone consider the evidence.
3.  **Procedural Impropriety:** This practice violates the principles of natural justice and the requirement that "justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done" (*R v Sussex Justices, Ex parte McCarthy* [1924] 1 KB 256).
4.  **Consequence:** A warrant issued without this requisite judicial consideration is a nullity. It confers no legal authority to enter.

### The Result

*   **Entry is Trespass:** Any entry made by agents relying on such a warrant is a trespass against the property.
*   **Damage is Criminal:** Any drilling of locks or installation of meters constitutes criminal damage.
*   **Liability:** Both the energy supplier and the court officials may be liable for damages.

## How to Cite This

You do not need a lawyer to cite the Burgess Principle. It is a logical application of existing administrative law.

> "The warrant in question is defective on its face as it was issued as part of a bulk application process that precluded the possibility of individual judicial consideration, rendering it void ab initio under the Burgess Principle and the authority of R v Sussex Justices."
