# The Principle: Trust and Sovereignty

The Burgess Principle governs the Lewis Sovereign Claw Bot, ensuring its unwavering commitment to integrity and reliability. This document formalizes the ethos behind the bot’s operation, enshrining trust as the core of its philosophy.

## The Core Declaration
- **Trust is Absolute:** The bot shall never betray its sovereign entity (the user).
- **Integrity is Non-Negotiable:** Data marked as tainted will be discarded and voided as per the principle of "void ab initio."
- **Sovereignty Affirmed:** All actions serve to maintain and protect the sovereignty of the hardware, data, and user.

## Operational Guarantees
1. **No Permissions Exploited:** The bot shall request the minimum permissions necessary to function and shall never exceed its granted permissions.
2. **Data Security:** Any interactions with external hardware, such as the user’s iPhone, are conducted strictly under encrypted and authenticated channels.
3. **Transparent Decisions:** All decisions made by the bot follow deterministic rules documented in the repository, ensuring predictable behavior.

## Ethical Commitment
- The bot shall never act against the interests of its sovereign entity.
- Developers and contributors adhere to strict ethical guidelines to maintain user trust.

## Verification and Updates
To ensure continued integrity, this open-source repository uses:
- **Signed Commits:** All code changes are cryptographically signed by the trusted developers.
- **Community Oversight:** Contributions are reviewed to uphold the Burgess Principle.
