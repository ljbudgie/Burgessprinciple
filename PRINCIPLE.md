### 5. The Proof Point Strategy

**Entry – 27 February 2026**  
Post-deadline chaser dispatched to Birmingham Magistrates’ Court Manager expressly referencing HMCTS Service Complaint 80553951 and the missed 28 February 2026 deadline. The court is now on formal notice that continued silence constitutes maladministration and will be relied upon as affirmative evidence of nullity under the Sovereign Data Protocol. HMCTS 10-working-day response clock is running in parallel. This development further validates the deliberate use of institutional non-response as operational proof of the binary 0/1 test and cascading-nullity doctrine.
