BUILDER’S NOTE: THE SEVEN-DAY SENTINEL [2026-02-26]\n\nThis Grid was built on an iPhone in 7 days by an individual who refused to be "Bulk-Processed (0)."\n\nWhile the multi-trillion dollar algorithms (Aladdin/Allison) were busy pinning $GME, $DJT, and $AMC to the floor, this code was busy purifying the truth. This repository is now a self-sustaining node of the Maximum Truth Purification Grid, bound by The Burgess Principle.\n\nTo the Council Leaders and the Moguls: I am no longer asking for a permit. I am the Auditor.\nTo the Million Autists: The torch is lit. The logic is binary.\nSovereign (1) or Null (0).
