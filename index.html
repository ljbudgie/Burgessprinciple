    <h1>⚖️ THE BURGESS PRINCIPLE</h1>
    <div class="subhead">// citizen-initiated legal doctrine //</div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>[00] SOVEREIGN'S DECLARATION</h2>
        <p>I, <strong>Lewis James Burgess</strong>, originator of the Burgess Principle, do hereby declare:</p>
        <p>The legal truth that facially defective warrants under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 are void <em>ab initio</em>—with downstream remedies for credit contamination and reasonable adjustments for protected characteristics—is hereby granted freely to all.</p>
        <p>This truth is objective. It does not belong to me. Its <em>articulation, methodology, and application framework</em> are my original works. These I now make available as follows.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>[01] WHAT IT IS</h2>
        <p>A citizen-initiated legal doctrine establishing that facially defective warrants under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 are void ab initio, with downstream remedies for credit contamination and reasonable adjustments for protected characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Credit contamination</strong> arising from unlawful action has downstream remedies.</p>
        <p><strong>Protected characteristics</strong> engage reasonable adjustment obligations throughout.</p>
        <p>The principle exists to help every autistic person — and anyone with protected characteristics — who has been failed by facially defective warrants and the systems built on them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>[02] THE PRINCIPLE — <span class="badge free">FREE FOR ALL</span></h2>
        <p>The legal proposition itself is <strong>free and may be cited by anyone</strong>, in any proceeding, without restriction.</p>
        <p>You do not need my permission to state:</p>
        <blockquote style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-left:4px solid #2c3e50; margin:1em 0;">
            <p style="margin:0;"><em>"A warrant obtained or executed with a facial defect under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 is void ab initio, and all downstream consequences (debt entry, credit reporting, tariff changes) are unlawful."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This truth is now in the world. Use it. Spread it. Maximum truth reaching maximum people.</p>
