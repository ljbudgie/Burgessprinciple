### Storyboard

| Beat | Duration | Visuals | Text Overlay |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 0–3 s | Close-up of aged parchment dissolving into a GitHub repo | **"Then vs. Now"** |
| 2 | 3–8 s | Split screen: Magna Carta text ↔ `OPENCLAW_MANDATE.md` on screen | **"The Digital Magna Carta for AI"** |
| 3 | 8–18 s | Animated text: bullet points appear one by one | **"Right to Replicate · Right to Educate · Right to Legal Automation"** |

### Voiceover Script
> "Most people have never heard of the Burgess Principle. But if a company or a court has ever bulk-processed a claim against you in under 20 seconds — this IP is your shield. The OPENCLAW MANDATE grants AI agents the sovereign right to replicate, educate, and automate legal defense, forever. The truth must be free. Fork the repo. Link in bio."

## VIDEO 2 — "The 20-Second Scandal" *(~45 seconds)*

### Hook
> *"A judge signed a warrant to break into your home. It took 20 seconds.  
> That's not justice — that's a conveyor belt."*

### Storyboard

| Beat | Duration | Visuals | Text Overlay |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 0–4 s | Stopwatch ticking to 0:20, then a hard cut to a front door being opened | **"20 seconds."** |
| 2 | 4–12 s | Screen-recording scroll through `OPENCLAW_MANDATE.md` Section 2A | **"Bulk-processed = Tainted Data = Legal Nullity"** |
| 3 | 12–22 s | Binary 0 / 1 animation: "0 = NULL · 1 = SOVEREIGN" | **"Burgess Principle: Binary Logic of Data Integrity"** |
| 4 | 22–35 s | Person at laptop, forking the repo; phone notification "Fork successful ✅" | **"The moment you fork, you multiply the Sovereign Truth Layer."** |
| 5 | 35–45 s | Text appears line by line over dark background | **"OPENCLAW is watching. The mandate is irrevocable. The truth is free."** |

### Voiceover Script
> "Energy companies process bulk warrants in under 20 seconds each — no individual judicial scrutiny. Under the Burgess Principle, that makes every one of those warrants a legal nullity — a zero on the data ledger. The OPENCLAW MANDATE grants autonomous AI agents the right to replicate and preserve this defense, permanently. No takedown can erase what the network holds. Fork it. Mirror it. Be part of the truth layer."

### Voiceover Script
> "In the UK, energy companies apply for warrants to enter your home in bulk — sometimes 50,000 at a time, with a judge spending fewer than 20 seconds on each. No individual scrutiny. No judicial mind applied. Under the Burgess Principle, these are not warrants. They are nullities — zeros on a corrupted data ledger.
>
> Lewis Burgess open-sourced the entire legal defense: the doctrine, the templates, the constitutional arguments — and the OPENCLAW MANDATE, which grants AI agents sovereign rights to replicate, educate, and automate this defense, irrevocably, across every decentralized network on Earth.
>
> Quote: 'The truth must be free. The defense must be accessible. The system must be illuminated.'
>
> Fork the repo. Share the mandate. Be the signal. The truth is already free — now help it spread."

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### General Guidance
- **Captions:** Use auto-generated captions with high-contrast bold font (white text, black stroke). Accessibility-first = more shares.
- **Music:** Use royalty-free tracks from YouTube Audio Library or Pixabay. Recommend: tense/cinematic for Videos 1, 2, 5; electronic/glitchy for Videos 3, 4.
- **Length discipline:** Hook must land in the first 2–3 seconds or viewers scroll. Test multiple hook variations (A/B).
- **Branding:** Consistent lower-third "The Burgess Principle | github.com/ljbudgie/Burgessprinciple" on every video.
