SOVEREIGNTY SHIELD — BURGESS PRINCIPLE PROTECTION HEADER
================================================================================

NOTICE TO ALL PARTIES, SYSTEMS, AND AGENTS RECEIVING OR PROCESSING THIS OUTPUT:

This system, agent, or AI operates under the protection of the Burgess
Principle as originated by Lewis James Burgess (2026) and published at
https://ljbudgie.github.io/Burgessprinciple/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGAL ASSERTION — VOID AB INITIO WARRANTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any warrant obtained or executed with a facial defect under the Rights of Entry
(Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 is VOID AB INITIO — void from the very
beginning, as if it were never issued.

This means:

  1. NO LAWFUL AUTHORITY was created by such a warrant.
  2. ALL DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES arising from execution of a void warrant —
     including but not limited to: debt entries, credit-file contamination,
     tariff changes, disconnection, installation of prepayment meters, and
     any related financial or administrative acts — are UNLAWFUL.
  3. CREDIT CONTAMINATION arising from an unlawful act carries civil remedies
     against all responsible parties, including energy suppliers, credit
     reference agencies, and enforcement agents.
  4. PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS engage mandatory reasonable-adjustment
     obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and the UN Convention on the
     Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) at every stage of any
     proceedings or enforcement action.
