## SECTION C — GROUNDS

*(Insert this text into Box 10 of the N244 form: "Brief summary of evidence in support" — or attach as a witness statement)*

### GROUNDS IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION

**The Applicant relies upon the following grounds:**

---

#### Ground 1: Procedural Impropriety — Lack of Individual Judicial Consideration

1.1 The *Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954* confers an exceptional power to override the common-law protection of the home. The exercise of that power by a magistrate or Justice of the Peace is a **judicial act**, not an administrative one, and demands that the magistrate apply their judicial mind to the **specific facts** of each individual case.

1.2 The Applicant has obtained / has reason to believe *(delete as applicable)* that the Warrant was issued as part of a **bulk batch** of warrants signed at a single sitting. Specifically: `[INSERT DETAILS — e.g., "court records obtained by DSAR dated [DATE] disclose that [NUMBER] warrants were signed between [TIME] and [TIME], a period of [X] minutes, making individual consideration of the facts of each case a practical impossibility."]`

1.3 In the premises, the magistrate did not, and could not, have applied their judicial mind to the specific circumstances of the Applicant's case. The Warrant was therefore granted without the judicial consideration that the law requires.

1.4 A warrant issued without genuine judicial consideration is **procedurally improper** and accordingly **void *ab initio***. It confers no rights on those who purport to execute it: see *R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy* [1924] 1 KB 256 (natural justice); and the general principle that the acts of an inferior tribunal that fall outside the scope of its lawful jurisdiction are void, not merely voidable.

---

#### Ground 2: Breach of Natural Justice

2.1 The rules of natural justice require, at minimum, that a person whose home is to be entered be **given notice** of the application and an **opportunity to be heard** before the warrant is granted, or that (if an ex parte procedure is followed) the court should apply particular rigour to the evidence presented.

2.2 The Applicant was given **no notice** of the warrant application and **no opportunity to make representations**. The absence of any such opportunity, combined with the bulk-processing of the application, means that the warrant was obtained in **breach of natural justice**.

2.3 The principle in ***R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy* [1924] 1 KB 256** — that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done — is directly applicable. An instrument issued by a process that has the outward appearance of a rubber stamp rather than a judicial determination cannot stand.

---

#### Ground 3: Entry Would Constitute Trespass

3.1 Because the Warrant is void *ab initio*, any entry by the Respondent or its agents purportedly in reliance on it would constitute **trespass to land**.

3.2 The Applicant has formally revoked any implied licence or right of access by notice dated `[DATE OF REVOCATION NOTICE]`, a copy of which is attached.

3.3 There is a real and imminent risk that the Respondent will attempt to execute the Warrant. An **injunction** is necessary to prevent irreparable harm that cannot adequately be compensated in damages alone.

---

#### Ground 4: Supporting Evidence

4.1 The Applicant relies upon:

- (a) This application notice and the grounds set out herein.
- (b) The witness statement of `[YOUR NAME]` dated `[DATE]`.
- (c) The documents exhibited thereto, including: `[list key documents, e.g., copy of the Warrant; DSAR response from [Supplier] dated [DATE] disclosing timing metadata; Notice of Revocation dated [DATE]]`.
- (d) Such further evidence as the Applicant may adduce with the Court's permission.
