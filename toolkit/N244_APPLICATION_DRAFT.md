# Application Notice (Draft Content for Form N244)

**In the [Name of Court]**  
**Claim No:** [Number if applicable]

**Applicant:** [Your Name]  
**Respondent:** [Energy Supplier Name]

---

**1. What order are you asking the court to make?**

*   A Declaration that the warrant of entry dated [Date] purporting to authorise entry to [Address] is **void *ab initio***.
*   An injunction preventing the Respondent from executing said warrant.
*   Costs of this application.

**2. Why are you asking the court to make this order?**

**Grounds of Application:**

1.  **Procedural Impropriety / Ultra Vires:** The warrant was issued as part of a "bulk application" process under the *Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954*. It is submitted that the issuing Magistrate/Justice of the Peace did not apply their judicial mind to the specific facts of this individual application, as required by law.
2.  **Lack of Judicial Consideration:** The volume of warrants signed in the relevant session precluded any meaningful review of the evidence. A "rubber-stamping" exercise is not a judicial act.
3.  **Breach of Natural Justice:** The process violates the principle that justice must be seen to be done (*R v Sussex Justices*).
4.  **The Burgess Principle:** The Applicant relies on the doctrine that a failure of individual judicial scrutiny renders the resulting instrument a nullity.
5.  **Evidence:** The Applicant will rely on the Respondent's inability to produce minutes or records demonstrating individual consideration of this case.

**(Statement of Truth)**  
I believe that the facts stated in this application are true.
