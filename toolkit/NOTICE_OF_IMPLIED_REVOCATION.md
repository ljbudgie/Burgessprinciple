## FORMAL NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF IMPLIED LICENCE AND RIGHT OF ACCESS

Dear Sir / Madam,

I, `[YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME]`, being the **occupier** / **owner-occupier** *(delete as appropriate)* of the property at `[YOUR FULL ADDRESS INCLUDING POSTCODE]` ("the Property"), hereby give you **formal written notice** of the following.

---

### 1. Revocation of Implied Licence

Any implied licence, permission, or right of access — whether arising by statute, contract, custom, or common law — that you or your agents, contractors, or sub-contractors may previously have enjoyed to enter the Property is hereby **revoked with immediate effect**.

This revocation extends to:

- meter reading;
- meter inspection;
- meter replacement (including installation of prepayment meters);
- disconnection or reconnection of supply;
- any other purpose connected with the supply of gas / electricity / both *(delete as applicable)*;
- entry by any third party acting on your behalf or under your instruction.

From the date of this notice, **no person may enter the Property on your behalf or for your purposes without my prior express written consent**.

---

### 2. Position Regarding Warrant Applications

I am aware that energy suppliers and network operators routinely apply for warrants under the *Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954* in bulk, and that in many instances such warrants are signed by a magistrate or Justice of the Peace without genuine individual judicial consideration being applied to the facts of each specific case.

A warrant issued without individual judicial consideration is **void *ab initio*** (void from the very beginning) pursuant to the legal doctrine commonly known as the **Burgess Principle** and the common-law rules of natural justice (*R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy* [1924] 1 KB 256).

Accordingly, I hereby put you on formal notice that:

(a) **Any attempt to enter the Property purportedly under a "bulk" warrant**, or a warrant that cannot be shown to have been the subject of genuine individual judicial consideration, will be treated as a **trespass**.

(b) **Any damage caused** to the Property, its fixtures, fittings, or contents in the course of such an attempted or actual trespass will be treated as **criminal damage** contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971, and will be reported to the police without further notice.

(c) I reserve the right to **seek an injunction** restraining any such entry, and to bring a civil claim for **damages** (including aggravated and exemplary damages) in respect of any trespass that occurs.

---

### 3. Demand for Proof of Individual Judicial Consideration

Should you obtain (or have already obtained) a warrant purporting to authorise entry to the Property, I require you to provide, **before any attempt is made to execute that warrant**, the following evidence:

1. The **name and title** of the specific magistrate or Justice of the Peace who issued the warrant.
2. The **exact date and time** at which the warrant application in respect of **this Property** was lodged with the court.
3. The **exact date and time** at which the warrant was signed / issued by the magistrate.
4. A copy of the **Information** laid before the court in respect of **this Property specifically** (not a generic template).
5. Any **notes, reasons, or minutes** recorded by the magistrate demonstrating that they applied their judicial mind to the facts of **this case individually**.
6. Evidence that the warrant was **not** signed as part of a bulk batch of applications at a single sitting.

Failure to provide this evidence will be treated as an admission that individual judicial consideration was not applied, and the warrant will be challenged as void *ab initio*.
