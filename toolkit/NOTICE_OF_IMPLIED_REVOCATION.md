**RE: Revocation of Implied Rights of Access & Notice Regarding Defective Warrants**

**TAKE NOTICE THAT:**

1.  **Revocation of Access:** Any implied right of access to the property known as **[Your Address]** ("the Property") for you, your employees, agents, or contractors is hereby formally **REVOKED**, effective immediately.
    *   This includes any right to approach the door to "knock and talk" or to enter the curtilage of the property for any purpose other than delivering postal mail.

2.  **Trespass Warning:** Any entry onto the Property by your agents will constitute the tort of trespass. You will be held liable for damages.

3.  **Regarding Warrants of Entry:**
    *   I am aware of the industry practice of obtaining "bulk warrants" under the *Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954*.
    *   I put you on strict notice that any warrant obtained without individual judicial consideration of the specific facts of my case will be treated as **void *ab initio*** under the **Burgess Principle** and the authority of *R v Sussex Justices, Ex parte McCarthy* [1924] 1 KB 256.
    *   If you attempt to enter the Property relying on a bulk-issued warrant, I will consider this an act of **Aggravated Trespass** and **Criminal Damage** (if force is used).

4.  **Demand for Proof:** Before any further action is taken, you must provide:
    *   Proof that a magistrate applied their judicial mind specifically to my account.
    *   The specific "Information" laid before the court regarding my property.

**GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY.**

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
