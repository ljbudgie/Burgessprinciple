## FORMAL DATA SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE 15 UK GDPR / SECTION 45 DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018

Dear Data Protection Officer,

Pursuant to **Article 15 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation** (UK GDPR) and **section 45 of the Data Protection Act 2018**, I hereby formally request access to all personal data you hold about me — with particular reference to the specific warrant-related metadata described below.

I am the data subject. My identity is confirmed by the account/reference details above. I am willing to provide a copy of photographic identification if required to process this request; please contact me to arrange this.

### 1. General Personal Data Request

Please provide:

(a) Confirmation of whether you process personal data about me.

(b) Copies of all personal data you hold about me, including but not limited to:
- account records, billing records, and payment history;
- correspondence (including internal correspondence referencing me or my property);
- call recordings, call logs, and notes of telephone conversations;
- records of any visits or attempted visits to my property;
- credit reference agency searches or notifications made in connection with my account;
- any data shared with third parties (including debt collection agencies, network operators, or courts).

### 2. Warrant-Specific Metadata — Priority Request

I specifically and urgently require disclosure of all personal data relating to any application made to a magistrates' court for a warrant under the *Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954* in respect of my property at:

**`[YOUR FULL ADDRESS INCLUDING POSTCODE]`**

Please provide all personal data held in connection with such an application, including but not limited to:

#### 2.1 Timing Metadata

- (a) The **exact date and time** (to the nearest minute) at which the warrant application relating to my property was **lodged with or submitted to** the court.
- (b) The **exact date and time** (to the nearest minute) at which the warrant was **signed, issued, or authorised** by the magistrate or Justice of the Peace.
- (c) Where applications were submitted in a batch, the **total number of applications** submitted in the same batch and the **total time elapsed** between submission and signing of the entire batch.

*The purpose of this request is to establish whether the time between lodging and signing was sufficient to allow the magistrate to apply their judicial mind individually to the facts of my case.*

#### 2.2 Magistrate / Justice of the Peace Details

- (d) The **full name** and **title** of the specific magistrate or Justice of the Peace who issued the warrant.
- (e) The **name and address of the magistrates' court** before which the application was made.
- (f) The **case or file reference number** assigned by the court to the warrant application.

#### 2.3 The Information Laid Before the Court

- (g) A complete copy of the **Information** (sworn statement or written application) laid before the court in support of the application — specifically the document relating to **my property**, not a generic or template version.
- (h) Copies of any **supporting documents, evidence, or exhibits** submitted to the court alongside the Information.
- (i) Confirmation of whether the Information was **sworn on oath** and, if so, the name of the person who swore it.

#### 2.4 Hearing Notes and Minutes

- (j) Any **notes, reasons, or minutes** recorded by the magistrate, court clerk, or any other person present at the hearing, demonstrating the basis on which the warrant was granted.
- (k) Confirmation of whether an **oral hearing** took place or whether the application was dealt with **on the papers** (without a hearing).
- (l) Any record of whether the occupier (me) was **given notice** of the application and an **opportunity to be heard**.

#### 2.5 Internal Correspondence and Decisions

- (m) All **internal emails, letters, notes, and records** created by you or your agents in connection with the decision to apply for a warrant in respect of my property.
- (n) The name and job title of the individual(s) within your organisation who **authorised** the application for a warrant.
- (o) Any **policy, guidance, or instruction document** relied upon in deciding to apply for the warrant (to the extent that such documents contain or inform the processing of my personal data).

---

### 5. Fees

I understand that you may not charge a fee for this request unless it is manifestly unfounded or excessive. This request is neither; it is specific, focused, and made for the legitimate purpose of understanding and, if necessary, challenging the basis of a warrant application affecting my home.

---

### 6. Right to Complain

I note that if you fail to comply with this request within the statutory timescale, I am entitled to lodge a complaint with the **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)** at [https://ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk) and/or to apply to the **County Court** for an order compelling compliance under section 167 of the Data Protection Act 2018.
