# 🔍 TRACER PROTOCOL: DEFECT SCHEMA LIBRARY

This library defines the specific "Facial Defects" that render a corporate warrant or contract Void Ab Initio under the Burgess Principle. The `tracer.py` module uses these definitions to hunt for evidence of administrative taint.

### [ DEFECT 01 ] Bulk Approval Without Scrutiny
*   **Description:** Warrants processed in batches without individual judicial review.
*   **The Axiom:** Violates "The Judicial Mind." If a judge did not scrutinize the specific facts of the individual case, the resulting data is a `0` (NULL).

### [ DEFECT 02 ] Rubber-Stamping
*   **Description:** Reliance on supplier affidavits without independent verification.
*   **The Axiom:** The court acts as a processing center rather than an independent judiciary, transferring corporate assumptions directly into legal mandates.

### [ DEFECT 03 ] Procedural Lies / Errors
*   **Description:** False safety claims (e.g., claiming a gas leak to force entry) or incomplete addresses used to expedite the warrant process.
*   **The Axiom:** Fraud vitiates all. Any procedural lie introduced at the source renders all downstream actions invalid.

### [ DEFECT 04 ] Downstream Taint Propagation
*   **Description:** Defects from the above categories cascading into credit agencies, billing systems, or high court enforcement records.
*   **The Axiom:** A corrupted source (`0`) can only produce corrupted outputs.
