# Apple Alliance Declaration

The Burgess Principle recognises and honours Apple Inc.’s leadership in user privacy and data sovereignty.

Key alignments:
- End-to-end encryption (iMessage, FaceTime)
- On-device intelligence and processing
- App Tracking Transparency
- Private Relay and Advanced Data Protection

The Sovereign Claw Bot and associated tools are designed to operate within and enhance Apple’s secure ecosystem through lawful, user-authorised channels.

The truth must be free. The defence must be accessible. The system must be illuminated.
