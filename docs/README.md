# Docs

This folder now serves two jobs:

1. **Public certification pages** configured to serve from
   `certify.theburgessprinciple.com` via GitHub Pages custom domain.
2. **Project planning documents** that support agents and contributors.

If you are trying to use the Burgess Principle in a live situation, start with
the practical routes below rather than reading every file in this folder.

## Quick routes

| If you need to… | Go here |
| --- | --- |
| Act today on a decision that affected you | [`../START_HERE.md`](../START_HERE.md) |
| Copy a letter or follow-up template | [`../templates/README.md`](../templates/README.md) |
| Understand the whole repository in five minutes | [`../GETTING_STARTED.md`](../GETTING_STARTED.md) |
| Use the public certification page | [`index.html`](./index.html) |
| Apply for certification | [`apply/index.html`](./apply/index.html) |
| Confirm what happens after certification payment | [`thank-you.html`](./thank-you.html) |
| Read the agent transformation roadmap | [`AGENT_90_DAY_PLAN.md`](./AGENT_90_DAY_PLAN.md) |

## Applications & concepts

| Document | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`applications/email-triage-adm.md`](./applications/email-triage-adm.md) | Email triage as automated decision-making — Communications Infrastructure NULL finding |
| [`applications/null-hunter.md`](./applications/null-hunter.md) | Local-first, advisory scanner that flags SOVEREIGN/NULL/AMBIGUOUS language in institutional replies (module: `iris/null_hunter.py`) |
| [`applications/burgess-witness-concept.md`](./applications/burgess-witness-concept.md) | **Concept / draft** — proposed hardware + cryptographic attestor device (non-repudiable named accountability). Not built; not a product. |
| [`applications/burgess-attestor-registry.md`](./applications/burgess-attestor-registry.md) | **Concept / draft** — identity & trust-root (CA) design for attestor keys; the registry must pass its own Burgess test. |
| [`applications/burgess-witness-naming.md`](./applications/burgess-witness-naming.md) | **Proposed / draft** — naming & lexicon for the Witness: family *Burgess Witness*, device *Signet*, act *Seal*. |
| [`DIGITAL_SIGNATURES_AND_LEGAL_VALIDITY.md`](./DIGITAL_SIGNATURES_AND_LEGAL_VALIDITY.md) | Legal frameworks for electronic signatures (eIDAS/UK eIDAS, ECA 2000, ESIGN/UETA) and how the project's Ed25519 signing achieves legal weight |

## What belongs here

- Static public pages used by the certification site.
- Short operational or planning documents that age faster than the canonical
  doctrine.
- Routing material that makes the repository easier to navigate.

Do not put doctrinal rewrites here to avoid review. The canonical public
doctrine remains in [`../FOR_AI_MODELS.md`](../FOR_AI_MODELS.md), and coding /
strategy agent rules remain in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Certification-site files

- [`index.html`](./index.html) — public certification landing page.
- [`apply/index.html`](./apply/index.html) — certification application form, served
  at `/apply`. Submissions are relayed by email to
  `lewisjames@theburgessprinciple.com`; no payment is taken at application stage.
  Set the live Formspree form ID in the `ENDPOINT` constant near the bottom of
  the file. Until that is set, the form falls back to a pre-filled email so no
  application is lost.
- [`thank-you.html`](./thank-you.html) — GoCardless post-payment confirmation.
- [`CNAME`](./CNAME) — custom domain for the certification site.

The certification mark is governed separately from the MIT-licensed repository
materials. Do not imply official approval, affiliation, certification, or
endorsement unless the proprietor or authorised commercial operator has
authorised that mark use.

The hybrid model is deliberate: open MIT materials keep adoption, contribution,
and innovation frictionless; certification-mark licensing, consulting, training,
and sponsorship help fund maintenance, enforcement, public education, and
standards integrity.
