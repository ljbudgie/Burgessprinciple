Free for Individuals
The Burgess Principle legal doctrine and basic self-help tools (warrant checker, simple correspondence templates) are provided free of charge for personal use by affected consumers and private individuals.

Commercial / Professional Use Requires Licence
Any law firm, barrister, claims-management company, charity, or other organisation using the materials in a professional, commercial, or group-litigation capacity must obtain a paid licence under the Burgess Principle IP Framework (22 February 2026). Use of the name “The Burgess Principle”, “Burgess Toolkit”, or any branded elements in commercial services without a licence constitutes trademark infringement (UK00004343685).

Existing MIT-licensed code remains available under its terms; however, advanced toolkit components, professional templates, quantification models, and ongoing updates are reserved for licensed users only. Contact lewisburgess_1987@hotmail.co.uk for Tier 2–5 licensing.
