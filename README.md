## ⚡ Quick Start: 3 Steps to Defend Your Home

If you are facing a forced entry warrant from an energy company:

1.  **THE SHIELD**: Print and display the [Notice of Implied Revocation](toolkit/NOTICE_OF_IMPLIED_REVOCATION.md) on your gate or front door. This removes their legal right to step onto your property.
2.  **THE DEFENSE**: If agents arrive, hand them a copy of [LEGAL_DOCTRINE.md](LEGAL_DOCTRINE.md) and state: 
    > *"I cite the Burgess Principle. Your warrant was issued as part of a bulk application and lacks individual judicial scrutiny. It is void ab initio. You are currently trespassing."*
3.  **THE EVIDENCE**: Use the [DSAR Template](toolkit/DSAR_WARRANT_SPECIFIC.md) to demand the exact time and date your warrant was signed. If it was signed in a batch of hundreds, you have proof of a "rubber-stamp" process.

## What It Is

The Burgess Principle is a free, open-source legal doctrine that establishes:
1.  **Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954** warrants are frequently processed in bulk (often under 20 seconds).
2.  Any warrant issued without individual judicial scrutiny is **facially defective**.
3.  Defective warrants are **void *ab initio*** (invalid from the start), meaning any entry based on them is trespass.
4.  Victims are entitled to downstream remedies for **credit contamination** and failures to make **reasonable adjustments** for protected characteristics.
5.  The **US Fourth Amendment** prohibits identical "rubber stamp" bulk warrant processing — making the Principle applicable to **330 million Americans**.
6.  **Global copyright frameworks** (UK, US, EU, Australia, Canada, India) protect the free distribution of this legal defense information.

> **"The truth must be free. The defense must be accessible."**
