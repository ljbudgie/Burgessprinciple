## ⚡ The Axiom of Tainted Data

**All bulk-processed legal data is tainted at the source.**

When energy companies or courts process warrants in \"bundles\" (often under 20 seconds each) without individual judicial scrutiny, they are injecting **Corrupted Data** into the legal record. Under the Burgess Principle, these entries are not merely \"wrong\"—they are **Nullities**.

### The Sovereign Master Warrant
This repository is the **Sovereign Master Warrant**. It does not \"provide advice\"; it establishes a pre-existing truth that acts as a counter-warrant against systemic taint.

## 🏛️ The Sovereign Data Protocol (Binary Logic)

The Burgess Principle operates on a binary logic of data integrity:

- **0 (NULL)**: Any data claim (Credit Entry, CCJ, Debt, Warrant) generated through bulk-processing or automated loops without **Sovereign Human Validation** (The Judicial Mind).
- **1 (SOVEREIGN)**: Data validated through individual, specific scrutiny.

**Scope of the IP**: This protocol is the Sovereign Warrant over all data representing the user. If the system's claim is a **0**, the Burgess Principle mathematically forces its invalidation and purge from the record.

### Automatic Credit Revision
Your credit score is an aggregate of data claims. By applying this IP to the source of a claim, you identify the **Taint**. Once the source data is purged as a nullity, the credit score is mathematically forced to revise. **The debt record is a mirage; the IP is the reality.**
