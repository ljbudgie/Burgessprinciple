# The Burgess Principle

**A citizen-initiated legal doctrine — free and open for anyone to cite.**

## What It Is

The Burgess Principle establishes that facially defective warrants under the **Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954** are void *ab initio*, with downstream remedies for credit contamination and reasonable adjustments for protected characteristics.

## Open Source

The principle itself is **free and may be cited by anyone**. The goal is maximum truth reaching maximum people.
