# The Burgess Principle

**A citizen-initiated legal doctrine — free and open for anyone to cite.**

## What It Is

The Burgess Principle establishes that facially defective warrants under the **Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954** are void *ab initio*, with downstream remedies for credit contamination and reasonable adjustments for protected characteristics.

## Open Source

The principle itself is **free and may be cited by anyone**. The goal is maximum truth reaching maximum people.

## Methodology & Toolkit — Open Source

The methodology and toolkit are **fully open source**, licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Free for anyone to use, adapt, and build upon.

Integrated with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.im) — the open-source AI automation platform for law.

## Auto-Pilot — Always Watching

The system now runs on an **hourly schedule** via GitHub Actions, effectively operating as a **24/7 Surveillance** mode. No longer limited to once a day — it is constantly active, scanning every hour around the clock.

> "What's stopping you from going 24/7?" — Nothing.
