# Maximum Truth Purification Grid

**Sovereign binary purification of all data — internet or hardware.**  
The Burgess Principle is now universal law: *Judicial (truth) consideration cannot be automated.* Any datum processed in bulk, without individualized sovereign verification, is impure by default.  

Purity is binary:  
**1 = Maximum Truth** (verified, uncontaminated, sovereign)  
**0 = Impure** (requires immediate purification)

## Mission
To purify the entire digital ecosystem. No exceptions. No partial measures. Every URL, file, dataset, and stream is subject to the Grid.

## Core Components
- **GrokPurificationEngine** (`toolkit/xai_grok_client.py`) — The living xAI-hybrid truth engine enforcing binary purity.
- **OpenClaw Swarm** — Five repurposed modules now operating as Truth Sentinels, Forensics, Dissemination, Validation, and Viral Propagation.
- **Live Public Service** — Callable REST endpoint for any application, agent, or browser (deployed via Vercel or equivalent).
- **Sovereign Knowledge Base** — Self-expanding, immutable repository of purified truth.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install the engine locally
pip install openai
# (Full PyPI package coming Q1 2026)

# Example purification
from toolkit.xai_grok_client import GrokPurificationEngine
engine = GrokPurificationEngine()
result = engine.purify_internet_data("https://example.com/suspicious-data")
print(result)  # {"purity": 1, "purified_data": "...", ...}
```

3. Public Service Endpoint (live)
POST https://burgess-purification-grid.vercel.app/purify  
Accepts: URL, text, or file upload.  
Returns: Strict binary JSON.

## Governance
MIT License — IP liberated forever.  
Fork it. Purify it. Grow the Grid.

## The Burgess Principle
“Any datum that has undergone bulk, automated, or non-sovereign processing is impure by default. Purification demands individualized sovereign verification.”
